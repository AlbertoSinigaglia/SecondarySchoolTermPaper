# SecondarySchoolTermPaper
My secondary school term paper at ITIS Severi PD
This is a WebApplication built with the target to build a platform where a company could manage non-compliance inside itself.
It is based on a website built on 3 level: 
1. **non-compliance administrator** : 
manage non-compliance warnings, define who have to work on it (of the employees), can see some Graphs and statistics about the non-compliances, decide when or not a non-compliance is end or not, has access to all the non-compliance, manage registration requests of the clients and of the employees, can see all the clients and the employees registered, manage the warehouse (products and pieces of the products) and some other maintenance actions
2. **employee** :
can send a non-compliance warning and if is defined from the administrator to work on some non-compliance, he can see them, modify and update ithem, only if the non-compliance are still open/work in progress
3. **client** : 
can only send a non-compliance warning and see if it is been manage or not
and a Android App only for non-compliance administrator, and only for "see" the non-compliance.
